# Covid-19-Tweet-Analysis


The COVID-19 pandemic is a global outbreak of the coronavirus, an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

The first cases of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus quickly spreading to other countries around the world. This led the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and to designate the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2 million people have died from the disease in the European region.

Sentiment analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus can provide valuable insights into public opinion and perception of the virus. It can be used to track changes in sentiment over time, identify influential users and groups, and identify specific issues or concerns related to the virus. However, it is important to note that sentiment analysis is not a straightforward task and results may vary depending on the dataset, pre-processing and modeling used. Sentiment analysis of tweets can be challenging due to informal language, use of slang and emoticons, and the presence of sarcasm and irony.

  Social media users are increasing with time because they are addicted to social media for informative content and data volume is also increasing; this focused on the use of natural language processing (NLP) with various algorithms Artificial intelligence (AI) for efficient acquisition of meaningful information.

  NLP and its applications have had a significant impact on social media text analysis and classification; however, problems with determining the inherent importance of content using NLP strategies such as contextual phrases and words, and ambiguity in the text or speech, require the use of ML-based algorithms.

  In this study, we used data from Twitter for sentiment analysis to identify public sentiment and explore heightened fear associated with the coronavirus. Many traditional approaches have been used for the identification of human behaviour and nature, which presents the possibility of increasing the analysis by quickly performing sentiment classification using NLP techniques.

  In this project of Sentiment Analysis, some of the techniques we have used are- Loading Data, Data Wrangling, EDA and data visualisation, Text preprocessing, handling imbalance in the datatset, tfidf vectorisation, train-test split and then we have built multiclass classification model.
